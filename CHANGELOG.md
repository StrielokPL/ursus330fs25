# Changelog

## 0.0.0.2 - prerelease

Development baseline for the Ursus C-330 / C-330M FS25 rebuild.

### Imported state
- Reset project development version from the original package version `1.1.2.0` to `0.0.0.2`.
- Confirmed `StrielokPL` as the first listed author in `modDesc.xml`.
- Confirmed that the uploaded source package already contains the previously tested **Static Cabins** compatibility fix from `Farming25fixnmix`; the patch was not applied a second time.

### Static Cabins compatibility fix already present
- 18 cabin-related `movingTool` definitions removed.
- Corresponding Interactive Control entries removed.
- Cabin animations `leweDrzwi`, `praweDrzwi`, `dach` and `okno` removed.
- Cabin configurations retained as static geometry.
- Only 3 technical tractor `movingTool` definitions remain.
- Dirty-flag usage reduced to avoid the multiplayer collision previously observed between the original tractor setup, Advanced Damage System and AIAutomaticSteering.
- Original compatibility test: Advanced Damage System 0.9.2.4 enabled, AIASF debug enabled, no erroneous Automatic Steering updates observed.

### Documentation
- Added technical C-330 baseline for later physics correction.
- Documented planned targets for mass, axle load distribution, engine torque, gearbox, ballast, PTO and rear linkage.

### Not yet changed in 0.0.0.2
- Engine torque curve and rated power.
- Gear ratios and top speed.
- Base mass and axle load distribution.
- Factory ballast masses.
- Tyre/traction calibration.

This version is intended as a clean compatibility and documentation baseline before the physics rebuild begins.
